#### Wait, so... what's Vagabond?
Vagabond is a map curator designed to help you make the most of your free time with user generated maps. Looking to visit all the historical landmarks in a given city? Got your pub-crawl crew assembled? Our extensive collection of maps are handcrafted by the experts who would know best, YOU! 

Of course, by you we mean others just like you... that know the area they're mapping... you get it. Creating maps is just as fun as using them! Be a front-runner of your city. Want to make sure visitors go to your favorite spots? worried they might be led astray? You'll act as the authoritarian for any area you've been to. Show the people a good time!
